# Twitter-Stock-Analysis
Twitter is one of the popular social media applications where people share what they feel in a limited number of words. Twitter is popular but not in the stock market. As Twitter is being delisted from the New York stock exchange, letâ€™s analyze the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market.

Twitter started its journey in the stock market in 2013. So to analyze the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market, we need the stock price data of Twitter from 2013 to 2022. I found a dataset that contains the data we need for this task.
The datase was taken from kaggle.

The dataset contains data about:

1. Date
2. The opening Price of the day
3. The highest price of the day
4. The lowest price of the day
5. The closing price of the day
6. The adjusted closing price of the day
7. The total number of shares traded in the day (volume)
